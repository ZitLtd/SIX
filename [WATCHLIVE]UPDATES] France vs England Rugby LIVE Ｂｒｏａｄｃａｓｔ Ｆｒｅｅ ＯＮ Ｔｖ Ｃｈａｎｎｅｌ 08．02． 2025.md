A dynamic first-half disintegrated into defeat for Steve Borthwick's England against Ireland on the opening weekend of the 2025 Six Nations, and the head coach has shuffled his deck for the daunting visit of this championship's early pace-setters.

Marcus Smith has shifted to his less accustomed position at full-back with the promising, yet largely untested, Fin Smith grabbing the No10 jersey. It will be the 22-year-old's first Test start following seven caps off the bench.

Elsewhere, Ollie Sleightholme replaces the injured Cadan Murley on the wing and the Premiership's form number eight Tom Willis replaces Ben Curry in the back row.

Fit-again hooker Jamie George and utility back Elliot Daly are among the replacements. Second row Maro Itoje plays his first match at home since taking the captaincy off George.

For the visitors, Romain Ntamack is suspended following a cynical red card against Wales, with Matthieu Jalibert recalled at 10. Damian Penaud also returns following a minor knock.

The devastating winger has plundered 36 tries in 53 caps – including two in the 2023 Six Nations victory that remains England's heaviest home defeat.

The 28-year-old is just two shy of France's record try-scorer Serge Blanco.

In the 111 fixtures between these proud nations, England have claimed 60 victories to France's 44, but the visitors are on a three-match winning run. England last beat France in the 2021 Six Nations, edging a narrow contest 23-20 in Twickenham.
