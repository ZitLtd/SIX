England vs France Live Stream: How to Access It Abroad?
To watch France vs England online for free, you‚Äôll have to use ITVX. ITVX is a free streaming service, which allows you to watch ITV‚Äôs shows, series, and live sports events.

As England faces France in this Six Nations duel, ITVX will officially broadcast the match on February 8th at 4.45 pm. Unfortunately, ITVX works exclusively in the United Kingdom.

Users abroad will face a geo-restriction problem due to the lack of a UK IP address. ITVX determines your location based on your IP address. If it‚Äôs abroad, you‚Äôll see a blank, black screen.

If it‚Äôs within UK borders, you have access to the England vs. France broadcast.

People online have found a way to unblock ITVX and watch England vs. France online for free outside the UK. They reported using a VPN, such as NordVPN, which is efficient at overcoming geo-blocks and allowing swift access to ITVX.

NordVPN is also risk-free for 30 days, which many users love.

It allows them to stream England vs France live outside the UK and get refunded as soon as the match ends. Not to mention, it offers fast speeds for HD streaming, unlimited bandwidth, and apps for all devices.

Once people sign up for NordVPN and set it up, all they have to do is connect to a UK server. In return, the original IP will be swapped for the UK one, providing uninterrupted access to ITVX.

Where to Watch Other Six Nations Matches?
If you‚Äôre craving more rugby action, this free England vs. France stream is just the beginning. As mentioned, you can watch all the Six Nations matches on ITVX and BBC iPlayer.

BBC iPlayer also works outside the UK with NordVPN using the same method.

For example, the next match, Scotland vs. Ireland, will be broadcast on BBC. After that, England vs. Scotland will be broadcast on ITV. We recommend checking the official Rugby World Cup website for the full Six Nations broadcast schedule.

As the championship progresses, you‚Äôll find out which match is broadcast on which streaming platform. That way, you can use NordVPN, obtain a UK IP address, and tune in to the right one.

Don‚Äôt forget that ITVX and BBC require a free account to work. However, there‚Äôs no need for a TV license, credit cards, or anything similar. With the trick that people online use, you can make an account in seconds and watch England vs France live for free no matter where you are.
