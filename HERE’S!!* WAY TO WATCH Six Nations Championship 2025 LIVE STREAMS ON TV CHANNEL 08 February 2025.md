Watch an England vs France live stream as the in-form Les Bleus look to inflict another defeat on their bitter rivals in a fixture dubbed Le Crunch. Below we have all the info on how to watch England vs France from anywhere, with details on worldwide TV channels, broadcasters, free streams and start times.

England enter this crucial encounter on the back of a poor run of form that has seen them lose seven of their last nine Test matches, including the 27-22 defeat to Ireland last weekend. Steve Borthwick’s side appear to have developed a worrying habit of losing close encounters, as they did last year when France secured a 33-31 victory in Lyon. They will hope to buck the trend this weekend and appear set to shake up their starting XV, with Marcus Smith set to start at full-back and Fin Smith at fly-half.

Many people’s pre-tournament favorites, France opened their Six Nations account with a brutal 43-0 victory over Wales. It was all too easy for Les Bleus in Paris and they will expect a far tougher challenge in Twickenham, especially after the news that fly-half Romain Ntamack will be suspended for the game after his red card against Wales. However, Fabien Galthié’s side have fond memories of playing in London, having thrashed England 53-10 in 2023.

France have won their past three games against England in the Six Nations. Will they make it four in a row at Twickenham? Tune in to find out.
