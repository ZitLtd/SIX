The English tale of woe continued in Dublin, as Steve Borthwick's side got off to a flyer in the opening 10 minutes before failing to score a try for over an hour in defeat against Ireland.

For the French, it was almost the dream start in an emphatic win over Wales in Paris.

Seven unanswered scores saw them run away as 43-0 winners, but a late red card for Romain Ntamack put a dampener on things.
