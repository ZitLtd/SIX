England enter this crucial encounter on the back of a poor run of form that has seen them lose seven of their last nine Test matches, including the 27-22 defeat to Ireland last weekend. Steve Borthwick’s side appear to have developed a worrying habit of losing close encounters, as they did last year when France secured a 33-31 victory in Lyon. They will hope to buck the trend this weekend and appear set to shake up their starting XV, with Marcus Smith set to start at full-back and Fin Smith at fly-half.

Many people’s pre-tournament favorites, France opened their Six Nations account with a brutal 43-0 victory over Wales. It was all too easy for Les Bleus in Paris and they will expect a far tougher challenge in Twickenham, especially after the news that fly-half Romain Ntamack will be suspended for the game after his red card against Wales. However, Fabien Galthié’s side have fond memories of playing in London, having thrashed England 53-10 in 2023.

France have won their past three games against England in the Six Nations. Will they make it four in a row at Twickenham? Tune in to find out.
