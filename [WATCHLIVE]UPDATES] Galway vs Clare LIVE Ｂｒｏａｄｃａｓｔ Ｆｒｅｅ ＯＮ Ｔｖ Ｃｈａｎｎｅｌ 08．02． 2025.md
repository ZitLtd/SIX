Despite coming out of last year with the All-Ireland title, Clare are still seeking their first win of this Allianz National Hurling League.

Their opening fixture against Kilkenny ended in a narrow two-point defeat to the Cats in Ennis. Standing in their way of two points this weekend is Galway, who are back under the management of Micheál Donoghue.

The Tribesmen have had a mixed start to the season, losing their opening game to less-fancied Tipperary at Pearse Stadium and then winning by a goal over Kilkenny at Nowlan Park in what has been a tight Division One.

Paul Mannion and Gavin Lee’s return in that Kilkenny game will encourage Galway fans that they can turn over the Liam MacCarthy holders, who have been without key players such as defenders Conor Cleary and Diarmuid Ryan.

When and where does Clare play Galway in the Allianz Hurling League?
Clare will travel to Pearse Stadium to play Galway on Saturday, February 8.

Throw-in is scheduled for 7.30pm.

Where can I watch Clare v Galway?
TG4 will broadcast the Allianz Hurling League fixture between Clare and Galway.

Clare hurling fans are in for a treat this weekend with the small ball dominating the TV and streaming line-up with five of the six games, including Clare's trip to Salthill to take on Galway. 

TG4 once again leads the charge as they are set to broadcast five of the six fixtures, beginning with the Ladies Division 1 clash of Dublin and Armagh at 3.30pm on Saturday. RTÉ's sole game of the weekend features Wexford hosting neighbours Kilkenny in Chadwick's Wexford Park at 5.30pm before TG4 airs Galway and All-Ireland champions Clare at 7.30pm.

On Sunday, Offaly and Antrim start the ball rolling with the first of three games on TG4. They will be followed by the appetising fixture of Limerick and Tipperary before signing off the weekend with deferred coverage of Laois and Waterford in Division 1B.
