The Red Rose kicked off its campaign in losing style after slipping to a 27-22 defeat against Ireland in Dublin last weekend.

France, meanwhile, underlined its billing as the team to beat in this year's tournament, with a resounding 43-0 victory over Wales last time out in a match that saw them score seven tries. 

Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to stream this Six Nations 2025 match, no matter where you are in the world. 

England vs. France: When and where?
England hosts France at Twickenham on Saturday, Feb. 8. Kickoff is set for 4:45 p.m. GMT local time, which makes it a 11:45 a.m. ET or 8:45 a.m. PT kickoff in the US and Canada, and a 3:45 a.m. AEDT start in the early hours of Sunday, Feb. 9, in Australia. 

How to watch England vs. France online from anywhere using a VPN
If you can't view this year's Six Nations locally, you may need a different way to watch this match; this is where a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic. It's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network and want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.

With a VPN, you can virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.

Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Australia, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.

Looking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now. 

ExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100 you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month.
